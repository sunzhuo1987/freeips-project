I wrote ANTI for fun and with this being the first public release
you can be sure that things may not work as you expect and some
things may not work at all.  The lack of any good documentation
will probably also be... how can I say this..  a bit difficult for
you to play with this program at all.

Here are some tips to get you started:

*-  Use on FreeBSD only (7.2-STABLE works)
*-  Compile by typing in this directory: "make"
*-  You'll need libpcre and libxml2 
*-  Run from this directory using: ./ANTI -i iwn0 -c config/config.xml
*-  Check out config/signatures/example.conf 
*-  Check out all files in src/ 
*-  Download Snort signatures and load them (90% should load fine)
*-  For inline mode, check support/divert.sh
*-  To build a vmware image, check support/vmware.sh

The IDP currently includes one ugly hack (more actually but I'll
keep the others for myself) which is for the support of the
Snort 'uricontent' signature keyword which I simply mapped to the
'content' keyword. As a result, you can expect false positives when
using such signatures. I may actually fix this... ;-)

Have fun ! Contact me for any questions / suggestions..
