Divert is pretty easy.. add the following rule to IPFW for diverting
IPv4 packets to divert port 2222. Then tell FreeIPS to pick these
packets up... based on the evaluation and signature "action" packets
/sessions are passed or dropped.


ipfw add 410 divert 2222 ip4 from any to any
./FreeIPS -I -P 2222 -S config/
