          Welcome to this FreeIPS IDP vmware image !
          ----------------------------------------

In vmware, make sure that you have bridged your active interface
with the vmware interface so that FreeIPS can actually see some traffic

The following command should probably be get you started. If not
then have a look at the config.xml file and change the interface name

# cd /usr/local/share/FreeIPS/
# FreeIPS -c config/config.xml
