             Welcome to this FreeIPS vmware image
           ----------------------------------------

In vmware, make sure that you have bridged your active interface
with the vmware interface so that FreeIPS can actually see some traffic
The following command should probably get you started. If not: check the
config.xml file and modify it (use /tmp) or run FreeIPS with -h to see
what other command-line options are available.

# FreeIPS -c /root/config.xml
