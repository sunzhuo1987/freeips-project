#summary This page summarizes how FreeIPS works


= Summary =

FreeIPS is multithreaded and each thread has it task.  The below
picture shows how the threads communicate and how packets go trough
the IPS.  A sniffer thread listens on a interface or reads data
from a file. The packets read this way are pushed into into a
ringbuffer in memory. In paralel, the analyzer thread reads the
packets from the ringbuffer and does the signature matching.
