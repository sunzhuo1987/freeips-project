#summary Description on how to help testing

= Introduction =

All help and feedback is appriciated ! If you're interested to help out then<br>
have a look at the instructions below.In the near future a vmware image will be made<br>
available to make it even easier to experiment with the IDP.

If you run into any issues then please use the issues tab on this web site for<br>
reporting them or contact me directly: niels[at]heinen.ws

= Getting started =

Before getting started: you'll need the following

  # FreeBSD 6.`*` or higher
  # Libxml2    (/usr/ports/textproc/libxml2)
  # libpcre    (/usr/ports/devel/pcre)
  # subversion (/usr/ports/devel/subversion)

===Get the code===
 * svn checkout http://freeips-project.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ freeips-project-read-only

===Build the IDP===
 * cd freeips-project-read-only
 * make

===Run the IDP===
  * ./FreeIPS -i "interface" -S "path to signatures>"
  * E.g: ../FreeIPS -i xl0 -S config/signatures/
Alternatively, edit "config/config.xml" and set the interface, signature path and<br>
anything else you want to enable, disable. Then run the IDP with the comment:
 * ../FreeIPS -c config/config.xml

===Ok and then..===

*Tip 1*<br>
You can keep your code in sync using the command "svn update" in the freeips-project-read-only
<br>
directory.

*Tip 2*<br>
You'll notice that there are no signatures with the default install. You can get these<br>
from http://www.snort.com or http://www.emergingthreats.net/

 * fetch http://www.emergingthreats.net/rules/emerging.rules.tar.gz
 * tar -zxvf emerging.rules.tar.gz
 * ./FreeIPS -i xl0 -S rules/
