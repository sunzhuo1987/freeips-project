#summary Inline quick notes

Setting up inline mode is not that hard. Just make sure that your machine can already <br>
function as a gateway AND that it has IPFW configured. Add the following rule to divert<br> traffic to FreeIPS:<br>

  * ipfw add 410 divert 2222 ip4 from any to any

Now tell FreeIPS to get the traffic:
  *./FreeIPS -c config/config.xml -I -P 2222

Your config.xml needs to be modified for your needs and keep in mind that you can also <br>
configure the inline mode and port in the config.xml file
